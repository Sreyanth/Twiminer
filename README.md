This folder contains two sub folders.
`final` and `validation`
	
final			=> Final code, documented properly
validation		=> Mostly not documented, we used this for tuning

NOTE regarding validation folder:
Just in case if you are curious as to how we began our journey, what all models we used, tried tuning and what we ended up with, you can see it all in the validation folder.

MORE DETAILS ON THE FINAL CODE IS FOUND IN `final` FOLDER'S README.txt FILE.
